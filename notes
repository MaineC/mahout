check - mark long running tests as nightly
check - untangle the huge jar for quicker build cycles
check  - move writeables out
check  - move cli stuff out
check  - move all other stuff out - aggregator module
check  - split distributed row matrix into job and hadoop stuff
check  - move spectral clustering back into hadoop
check  - get rid of the stupid test jar stuff
check  - get all other driver stuff moved to hadoop, leaving only cli in cli
check  - algorithm defaults are somewhat hidden in defaultoptioncreator for cmd options
check  - copied TasteTestCase - fix
check  - factor recommenderconfig defaults for itemsimilarity job and recommender job out
check  - re-execute tests marked as nightly and check for failing tests - generate toString, equals, hashcode etc for config beans *sigh* I love boilerplate

Fix remaining issues
  - check methods in AbstractJob and AbstractCLI and move anything out that does not strictly belong there
  - check MahoutTestCase, MahoutTestCase, MahoutHadoopTestCase, TasteTestCase, SolverTest and name speakingly
  - move option name static fields to cli classes
  - double check assembly file
  - introduce test setups that delete test path
  - introduce randomizer package for solvertesthelper
  - remove code commented out in hebbiansolvertest
  - turn todo and similar in code into jira issues
  - copied class for df.data - fix
